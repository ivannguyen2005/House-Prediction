# House-Prediction

Predicting U.S. housing prices using real estate data by state and ZIP code.  
Includes data cleaning, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, and machine learning to build a reliable price prediction model.

## Project Contents
- `Untitled2.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with the full data analysis and modeling pipeline.
- `realtor-data.zip.csv`: Dataset file tracked with Git LFS.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/ivannguyen2005/House-Prediction.git
   ```
2. Make sure you have Git LFS installed to properly handle the large CSV file:
   ```bash
   git lfs install
   ```
3. Install Python dependencies (adjust packages as needed):
   ```bash
   pip install pandas numpy scikit-learn matplotlib jupyter
   ```
4. Launch the Jupyter Notebook:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook Untitled2.ipynb
   ```

## Notes

- The CSV dataset is large and stored using Git LFS. If you don’t have Git LFS installed, the file won’t download correctly.
- Feel free to explore the notebook step by step to understand the data cleaning, feature engineering, and modeling approach.
